Tuxnix
======

Tuxnix is a collection of opinionated modules and a limited framework to build nixos system.

Most modules were contributed by Tuxera inc. which is also where the name comes from.

Impermanence
============

Modules `systemd-efi`, `tmproot`, `hardware` and `volatile-root` add a basic
`hardware-configuration.nix` like environment for impermanent like system.
Those are intended to be a starting point for using these modules, you are
obviously able to copy-paste whatever seems useful to you.

TODO
====

Add documentation and more generally useful items, if there is general interest in using this
system.
